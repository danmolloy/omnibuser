**Omnibuser is no longer being actively maintained**

I will continue to fix critical bugs, but I will not be doing any new feature development or addressing minor problems.

I originally built Omnibuser as a way to learn Ruby on Rails. It was mostly for personal use, and I didn't expect many people to be interested in it. I ended up being wrong about that - a slow trickle of people started using it after I posted it on reddit and since then the numbers have steadily grown. I've been amazed and thankful for how many people found my little fanfic app useful - we've had over 300,000 downloads since release!

I had a lot more ideas for Omnibuser, new features and ways to improve the user experience. I use it quite a bit myself, and I know how clunky and annoying it can be, and how many cool things it can't do. But shortly after releasing V1.1, I got an awesome job thanks to my new Rails skills. As a very junior developer, writing code for 8 hours a day was pretty draining, and I found I wasn't really able to work on personal projects on top of that. So all the ideas I've had, and all the cool ideas people have emailed me about, have been gathering dust on a Trello board somewhere for the past couple of years.

I'm a bit more experienced now, and I'm finally able to put consistent time into personal projects on top of my day job. I thought about coming back to Omnibuser and adding all those cool features. But it's been a long time since I've worked on it, and looking at it now is like reading someone else's code. The code quality is pretty terrible - it looks like it was written by someone just starting to learn Rails! I wouldn't be happy slapping new stuff on top of such an amateurish foundation, I'd have to rewrite the whole thing. 

So instead of doing that, I'm working on a new app, which takes a different approach to the "reading fanfic as an ebook" idea. It's still in early stages, but I'm very excited about it, and when it's released I think it will make Omnibuser obsolete. So if you've been waiting patiently to see if your suggestion ever makes it into Omnibuser, all hope is not lost. I'll be taking on board all the feedback I've received, and I'll aim to make the new app the best fanfic reading tool possible!

No release date for the new app yet, it won't be ready for at least a few months. If you'd be interested in helping me beta test closer to release, please do get in touch!

<p>There were secrets that were better off shared than holed up inside someone like a slowly ticking time bomb. Then there were some things were meant to be kept in the dark. The GoM and Kagami found that out the hard way.</p>
<p>Kuroko walked off of the Seirin High School grounds, ready to enjoy the long break stretched in front of him. Not to mention the breather from basketball and the pressure of games constantly around the corner.</p>
<p>"KUROKOCCHI!"</p>
<p>Out of habit, the short athlete stepped aside and watched as his friend dove head-first into the pavement.</p>
<p>"Hello, Kise-kun," he deadpanned, oblivious to the cries of pain issuing from the blonde. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to see Kurokocchi, of course!" Kise smiled happily and again, Kuroko was reminded of an over-energized dog. "For the first time in forever, the modeling agency finally let me have a break, so I decided to spend the first day of spring break with you!"</p>
<p>"What do you want to do, then?" Kuroko asked, pulling Kise to his feet. "I was actually going to meet up with Kagami-kun, so if you are okay with that..."</p>
<p>"Of course!" Kise chirped. "I've always wanted to hang out with Kagamicchi! Ooh," Kise closed his eyes and clenched his teeth bracingly. "Actually, that may not be so good..."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Kise yelped. "You may not like this, but everyone actually got together to celebrate the end of out first year of highschool! (A/N: In Japan, there are three breaks from school, summer break, winter break, and spring break between school years.) So I hope it doesn't interfere with anything, it being so last minute."</p>
<p>"It's fine," Kuroko said with a smile as Kise cheered animatedly. "I just hope that there won't be too much conflict between the two Lights."</p>
<p>"That'll just make it more fun!" Kise chirped, grabbing Kuroko's arm and bouncing away with him in tow.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<p>Nostalgia was a common side-affect of hanging out with the Generation of Miracles. Sometimes, Kuroko was happy. Other times, he was sad.</p>
<p>Today, he was just tired.</p>
<p>"I bet I could take you in a one-on-one!"</p>
<p>"Hah! As if, Bakagami!"</p>
<p>"THE HELL DID YOU CALL ME?"</p>
<p>Kagami had not been pleased when Kuroko had showed up with a hyper Kise in tow, even less so when he learned of the unplanned gathering of all his strongest opponents. When Aomine arrived, the two Lights immediately hit it off with the challenges and name calling. Eventually, everyone arrived, and it was exactly as Kuroko remembered them. Midorima carrying some obscure object in his taped fingers and pretending and failing to look uninterested. Then Akashi and Murasakibara arrived, the giant hovering behind the point guard like some sort of protective bodyguard. The group started walking in some silently agreed on direction, Kuroko getting incresingly agitated with the two ace's bickering.</p>
<p>"YOUR LIGHT IS TOO WEAK! YOU-Ow!"</p>
<p>Aomine and Kagami both let out cries of pain in unison and glared down at Kuroko, rubbing their sides where the shadow had jabbed them in the ribs.</p>
<p>"What was that for?!"</p>
<p>"Kagami-kun," Kuroko deadpanned with an irritated expression on his face. "What if our senpais had your attitude? The way you are acting is not very prideful. It is like watching a child argue about the turn on a swing." Kagami grimaced and scratched his head bashfully.</p>
<p>"Why am I the only one being nagged on?"</p>
<p>"And Aomine-kun," Kuroko went on as though Kagami hadn't said anything. "If you nurse a vengeance by yelling taunts at your rival, you'll never beat him. Can I ask, have you been the second door lately?"</p>
<p>As the dark-skinned teen spluttered indignantly, Kuroko looked away. He didn't enjoy opening old wounds since it hurt him as much as it did the others. He was thankfully when Kagami burst out laughing. Kuroko could always count on his Light, on and off the court.</p>
<p>"So why are we heading to the convenience store?"</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Kuroko with surprise then realized that they were indeed on a familiar road. They had thought they were just wandering aimlessly around Tokyo, but by some unconscious whim, they were walking to the convenience store that the Teiko regulars had so often celebrated at. Kise laughed.</p>
<p>"That's to be expected, I guess," he rambled. "We always celebrated there, didn't we?"</p>
<p>"Remember when Kise-kun got admitted to the first-string?" Kuroko smiled. "We stopped a purse snatcher."</p>
<p>"Ha! Kise looked so weirded out!" Aomine snorted.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised," Kagami interjected. "When I first met you guys, I wondered why the Generation of Miracles were so weird. OW! Again?!"</p>
<p>"I do not appreciate being called weird, Kagami-kun," Kuroko said, his hand outstretched menacingly. "It makes it sound like you're not."</p>
<p>"But you're not part of the Generation of Miracles," Kagami said before Kuroko punched him. "You're Kuroko Tetsuya of Seirin, right? ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME?"</p>
<p>The GoM watched in amusement as Kuroko and Kagami argued with each other. One could tell how much the other knew about his friend, how close their trust was. As if on cue, the atmosphere in the rainbow heads became sad.</p>
<p>"It's kinda like us back in middle school," Aomine commented sullenly.</p>
<p>"I wish," Kise muttered, though it didn't go unheard by the other four who agreed wholeheartedly with what the blonde said next, "things could go back to the way they were."</p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<p>Yup, well, this is turning into an angst-y kinda story.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Well, hope you guys like it! I'll try to update my other fics, but I've been really busy this past week and then this fic got accidentally erased so I couldn't post this one quickly.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks!</p>

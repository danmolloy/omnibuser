# Omnibuser 1.1 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who has given feedback so far! I've been really encouraged by how many people have been using the site. I took a break after the site was first launched, but now I'm back with a fairly hefty update. Let me know what you think of the new features, and please report any bugs.

### Features

- **EPUB Support**
- **Embedded image support** - All embedded images in forum-based stories will now be included. To avoid huge file sizes, all images are converted to jpg and compressed
- **Cover images** - The author's avatar pic will be used where available, otherwise a placeholder
- **Stories are no longer cached** - Stories will be scraped fresh whenever they are requested
- **Reader mode** - On Sufficient Velocity and SpaceBattles, reader mode will be used to scrape stories, speeding things up greatly
- **Get only recent chapters** - Users can now get just the most recent chapters of a story. Once you're up to date on a story, it should be more convenient to use this feature to get any new chapters
- **CSS added to ebooks** - Ebooks will now be styled to look like the site they were published on
- **Correct handling for forum-specific formatting** - Spoiler boxes, quote boxes, coloured text, transparent text, embedded videos - this should all be handled sensibly
- **Table of contents and nav-links**

### Bugfixes & Tweaks

- Forums: The first post will always be included as the first chapter, even if it is not threadmarked
- Forums: Except when getting recent chapters, chapters are now ordered according to the threadmark order (defined by the author), instead of date
- Forums: Questionable Questing works now, except for forums that require an account to access
- File names are generally improved - fewer underscores, inclusion of accented characters
